## Digest

OpenWrt 是 Linux 分支中用于内嵌式设备的 OS，安装 Openwrt 让内嵌式设备具备客制化的功能，实现各种场景的需求

你也可能会常常看到另外一个名词 LEDE 和 OpenWrt 一起出现，其实 LEDE 和 OpenWrt 并没有实质的区别。Linux Embedded Development Environment 简称 LEDE，是因为 OpenWrt 中的一些开发者理念不同而产生新的分支。在 2018 年 OpenWrt 和 LEDE 重新合并，统称为 OpenWrt

由于 OpenWrt 客制化的属性，目前被广泛的应用于 router，这样的 router 也被称为 Linux-based router 中文叫 软路由。还有其他一些 OS 和 Openwrt 类似

- Merlin

  用于 Asus routers 

- ikuai

  国内开发的 OS，功能比较简单

## Why Use OpenWrt

1. Extensibility 扩展性

   OpenWrt provides many capabilities found only in high-end devices. Its 3000+ application packages are standardized, so you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device, including two (or even five) year old routers.

2. Security 安全性

   OpenWrt's standard installation is secure by default, with Wi-Fi disabled, no poor passwords or backdoors. OpenWrt's software components are kept up-to-date, so vulnerabilities get closed shortly after they are discovered.

3. Performance and Stability 性能和稳定性

   OpenWrt firmware is made of standardized modules used in all supported devices. This means each module will likely receive more testing and bug fixing than stock firmware which can be tweaked for each product line and never touched again.

4. Strong Community Support 强壮的社区

   OpenWrt team members are regular participants on the (主要有如下几个站点)

   - [OpenWrt Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/)

   -  [OpenWrt Developer](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel) 

   -  [OpenWrt Admin](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-adm) mailing lists,

   -  [LEDE's IRC channels.](https://openwrt.org/contact#irc_channels) 

     You can interact directly with developers, volunteers managing the software modules and with other long-time OpenWrt users, drastically increasing the chances you will solve the issue at hand. 

   5. Open Source/No additional cost 开源才是最关键的

      OpenWrt is provided without any monetary cost. It has been entirely created by a team of volunteers: developers and maintainers, individuals and companies. If you enjoy using OpenWrt, consider contributing some effort to help us improve it for others! All of the above is possible because OpenWrt is part of the Open Source community, and powered by Linux kernel.
