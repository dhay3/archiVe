在如下几种情况下，需要使用 past simple
1. 强调在过去某事已经完成，动作已经完成

### 0x04a complete action

看一个例子

> composing at the age of five and wrote more than 600 pieces of music. He was only 35 years old when he 
> died.

强调在过去某事已经完成，动作已经完成

```
I did = complete action
```

其中 lived/started/wrote/was/died are all past simple

例如
1. did you do that homework?
2. I wasn't hurry, so I didn't eat anything.
3. I enjoyed the party a lot.
4. Was the weather good when you were there.
