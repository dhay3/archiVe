2. 在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调整个过程[0x04b Rule 02](#0x04b%20Rule%2002)

看一个例子

在说出的时候，动作正在做还没有结束

```

> He means he started reading the book, but he hasn't finished yet. He is in the middle of reading it.

在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调整个过程

```
doing something = in the middle of doing it
```

例如
1. Kate wants to work in Italy, so she's learning Itanlian.(but perhaps she isn't learning Itanlian at the time of speaking.)
