# English 09 - Present Perfect vs Present Perfect Continuous

## 0x01 Overview

present perfect 和 present perfect continuous 最大的区别就在于，present perfect 中的 action 必须是完成的，而 present perfect continuous 中的 action 无需完成

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>present perfect continuous(I have been doing)</th>
<th>present perfect (I have done)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<i>There is paint on Kate’s clothes. She has been painting her bedroom.</i>
<br>
We are thinking of the activity. It does not matter whether it has been finished or not. In this example, the activity (painting the bedroom) has not been finished.
</td>
<td>
<i>The bedroom was green. Now it is yellow. She has painted her bedroom.</i>
<br>
Here, the important thing is that something has been finished. ‘She has painted’ is a completed action. We are thinking about the result of the activity (the painted bedroom), not the activity itself.

eg
<ul>
<li>My hands are very dirty. I’ve been repairing my bike.</li>
<li>Joe has been eating too much recently. He should eat less.</li>
<li>It’s nice to see you again. What have you been doing since we last met?</li>
<li>Where have you been? Have you been playing tennis?</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
eg
<ul>
<li>My bike is OK again now. I ’ve repaired it. (= I’ve finished repairing it)</li>
<li>Somebody has eaten all the chocolates. The box is empty.</li>
<li>Where’s the book I gave you? What have you done with it?</li>
<li>Have you ever played tennis?</li>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
We use the continuous to say how long (for something that is still happening)
</td>
<td>
We use the simple to say how much, how many or how many times (for completed actions)
</td>

<tr>
<td>
eg
<ul>
<li>How long have you been reading that book?</li>
<li>Amy is writing emails. She’s been writing emails all morning.</li>
<li>They ’ve been playing tennis since 2 o’clock.</li>
<li>I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t been learning it very long.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
eg
<ul>
<li>How many pages of that book have you read?</li>
<li>Amy has sent lots of emails this morning.</li>
<li>They’ve played tennis three times this week.</li>
<li>I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t learnt very much yet.</li>

## 0x02 Cautions

### verbs aren't used in the present perfect continuous

和 [present continuous](English%2004%20-%20Present%20Continuous%20VS%20Present%20Simple.md) 相同，有一些 verbs 不会和 present perfect contiuous 使用

但是除 want 和 mean 外
- She's been wanting to break the jail, but no luck.
- I’ve been meaning to phone Anna, but I keep forgetting.
