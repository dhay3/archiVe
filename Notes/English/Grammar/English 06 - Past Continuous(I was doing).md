## 0x04 When to Use

在如下几种情况下，需要使用 past continuous
1. 强调在过去某一时间正在做某事，动作没有完成
2. 在某事发生的过程中，发生某事

### 0x04a doing something at the certain time in past

看一个例子

> Yesterday Karen and Joe played tennis. They started at 10 o'clock and finished at 11.30.
> So, at 10.30 the were playing tennis.
>
> they were playing = they were in the middle of playing, they had not finished

强调在过去某一时间正在做某事，动作没有完成

```
I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing it at a certain time. The action or situation started
before this time, but had not finished.
```

例如
1. This time last year I was living in Hong Kong.
2. What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night.
3. I waved to Helen, but she wasn't looking.

### 0x04b something happened(past simple) in the middle of something else(past continuous)

在某事发生的过程中，发生某事

例如
1. Matt phoned while we were having dinner.
2. It was rainning when I got up.
3. I saw you in the park yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.
4. I hurt my back while I was working in the garden.

**But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another**

如果表示某事发生后，又发生了某事，需要使用 past simple

例如

*When Karen arrived, we were having dinner.(=we had already started before she arrived)*

在 Karen 来之前我们已经开吃了

*When Karen arrived, we had dinner.(=Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)*

在 Karen 来之后我们才开吃
