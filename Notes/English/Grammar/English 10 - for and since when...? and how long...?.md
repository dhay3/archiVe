# English 10 - for and since when...? and how long...?

## 0x01 Overview

for/since 都表示过去的一段时间

> We use for + a period of time: We’ve been waiting for two hours.
> We use since + the start of a period: We’ve been waiting since 8 o’clock.

可以和 present perfect 和 present perfect continuous 一起使用

## 0x02 for

> We often leave out for (but not usually in negative sentences)

在 present perfect 和 present perfect continuous 中 for 可以被省略，但是否定句中不能
