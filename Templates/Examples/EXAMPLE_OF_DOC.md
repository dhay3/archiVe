Tower of Babel（中文通常译为 “巴别塔”） 出自 Book of Genesis（创世纪，圣经旧约 11:1-9[^2]），用来解释不同语言和文化的起源

## 0x02 Babel in Bible

Babel 在 Bible 中第一章创世纪 11:1-9 中提到，主要内容如下

1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
	
	起初这个世界上只有一种语言

2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
	
	他们从东方来，住在 Shinar 的平原上
	
3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
	
	那里的人口口相传，让我们制作砖吧
	
4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
	
	然后他们又说，让我们建一座城市，一座塔吧，可以直耸天际
	
5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
	
	当 LORD 看到有他的子民建造地这座城市，这座塔时
	
6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
	
	LORD 说道，他们说着一种语言，是一体的，现在没有任何东西可以限制他们的想做的
	
7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
	
	让我们混淆他们的语言，让他们不能明白其他人说的话
	
8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
	
	LORD 将他们播撒到各地，他们也不再建造这座城市了
	
9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
	
	因此他被称为 Bebel

## 0x03 The Metaphor of Babel

Babel 可用于比喻注定不可能实现的事，就好比共产主义，夙愿很美好，但是人类本性卑劣
