2. 在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调整个过程[0x04b Rule 02](#0x04b%20Rule%2002)

看一个例子

> 
> This means: she is driving now, at the time of speaking. The action is not finished

在说出的时候，动作正在做还没有结束

```

```

例如

2. Where's Mark? He's having a shower.

### 0x04b Rule 02

看一个例子

> Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:

> 
> Steve says 'I'm reading ...' but he is not reading the book at the time of speaking.
> He means he started reading the book, but he hasn't finished yet. He is in the middle of reading it.

在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调整个过程

```
doing something = in the middle of doing it
```

例如
1. Kate wants to work in Italy, so she's learning Itanlian.(but perhaps she isn't learning Itanlian at the time of speaking.)
2. Some friends of mine are building their own house. Thy hope to finish it next summer.

### 0x04c Rule 03

当强调 periods arround now 时，例如 today/this week/this year.

例如

2. The company I work for isn't doing so well this year.

### 0x04d Rule 04

当事物在当下正在发生改变时

通常这些 verbs 会使用如下形式

changing,improving
starting,begining
increasing,rising,falling,growing

例如
1. Is your English getting better?
2. The population of the world is increasing very fast.
3. At first I didn't like my job, but I'm starting to enjoy it now.
