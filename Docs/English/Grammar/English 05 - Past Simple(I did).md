## 0x03 verb-ed

使用 past simple 时，在 plain 中和 he/she/it/sigular 一起使用， verb 需要变形。大多数只需要在结尾使用 **-ed** 即可，但是有一些特殊情况

### 0x03a y

如果单词以 **constant(vowel 取反) + -y** 结尾，需要去 **-y** 改为 **-ied**

例如
- hurry/hurried
- study/studied
- apply/applied

如果单词以 **vowel(a,e,i,o,u) + -y** 结尾，不需要去 **-y** 直接使用 **-ed**(除 say/said, pay/paid, lay/laid 外)

例如
- play/played
- enjoy/enjoyed

### 0x03b e

如果单词以 **-e** 结尾，直接加 **-d** 即可

例如

### 0x03c irregular verbs

> 具体看 Appendix 1

past simple 中有一些不规则的动词

例如

## 0x04 When to Use

### 0x04a complete action

看一个例子

> Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian musician and composer. He lived from 1756 to 1791. He started
> composing at the age of five and wrote more than 600 pieces of music. He was only 35 years old when he 
> died.

强调在过去某事已经完成，动作已经完成

```
I did = complete action
```

其中 lived/started/wrote/was/died are all past simple

例如
1. did you do that homework?
2. I wasn't hurry, so I didn't eat anything.
3. I enjoyed the party a lot.
4. Was the weather good when you were there.
