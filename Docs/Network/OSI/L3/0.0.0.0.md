In the context of servers, 0.0.0.0 can mean "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". If a host has two IP addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and a server running on the host is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, it will be reachable at both of those IP addresses.

0.0.0.0表示本机所有的IPv4地址

Port 0 is officially a reserved port in TCP/IP networking, meaning that it should not be used for any TCP or UDP network communications. However, port 0 sometimes takes on a special meaning in network programming, particularly Unix socket programming. In that environment, port 0 is a programming technique for specifying system-allocated (dynamic) ports.

0号端口常被保留，表示在TCP/UDP中不适用，但是在一些其他的编程语言中表示动态端口
